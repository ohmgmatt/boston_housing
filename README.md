# Boston Housing Data Set Analysis & Model Creation

This is a basic analysis on the boston housing data set acquired from https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~delve/data/boston/bostonDetail.html

In this project, we are attempting to create a model that will predict the median value of owner-occupied homes in the boston area.
We are given several features and use those to create our model.

We start off by performing variate analysis on the dataset to see how the data is structured.   
We then create an initial model, followed by an alternate model with different features.  
We compare the results and determine a conclusion from that.
